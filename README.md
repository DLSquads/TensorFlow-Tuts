<h1 align="center">TensorFlow Tuts</h1>

[Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) is the most starred Machine Learning library on github (last checked on 2nd October 2018) and is generally considered most battle tested library for Machine Learning in prduction! With this repository we are assimilating its knowledge at one single place.

If this repository helps you in anyway, show your love :heart: by putting a :star: on this project :v:

Directory structure we will be following is:

```
TensorFlow-Tuts
 |---datasets
 |      |---Dataset for every notebook will be in separate folder
 |---notebooks
 |      |---01-TensorFlowBasics.ipybn
 |      |---other notebooks...
```
> Note: Datasets folder will be gitignored.
